# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project shows a dashboard that allows a user to search a few weather details for any city in the United States. Users will then be able to see current and 5-day data for temperature, wind, and humidity. Cities that have already been searched will also be stored on the left panel.

This project helped me in the following ways:<br>
-Created and leveraged API data from the OpenWeather website<br>
-Gained more experience utilizing JavaScript to dynamically create, adjust, and append data to the application.<br>
-Experimented with the Bootstrap CSS framework<br>
-Utilized local storage to store city data<br>
